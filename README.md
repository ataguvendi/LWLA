A lightweight linear algebra package. Package provides a framework for future extensiblity and auto-parallelization of functions in HPC settings.

For developers, consider writing non-omp parallelized algorithms like CUDA and hybrid parallelize using the Layer-Apply-Unlayer pattern you can see examples
of in main.
